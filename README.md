# 🎙️ Slynx – Romanized Text to Native Speech




**Slynx** is an end-to-end speech pipeline that converts **romanized language text** into **native-script speech audio**. It is designed to assist **screen reader users**, individuals with **reading difficulties**, and anyone interacting with languages in romanized form.

---

## 💡 What It Does

1. **Language Detection** – Identifies the correct Indian language from text
2. **Transliteration** – Converts romanized text to native script (e.g., "mera naam Rahul hai" → "मेरा नाम राहुल है")
3. **Speech Synthesis** –generates natural-sounding speech

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📝 Romanized input support
- 🌐 Auto language detection (Hindi, Telugu, etc.)
- 🔊 Native speech output (e.g., WAV file)
- ⚙️ Modular and extendable classes
- ✅ Useful for assistive tools and screen readers

---

## 🔽 Download & Use Our Models

You can **download** or **directly use** our pretrained models for:

- 🔤 **Language Detection** (e.g., Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali and Marathi)
- 🔁 **Transliteration** from romanized text to native script (Hindi and Telugu)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-  Python 3.12


### To Run The Pipeline
```bash
# Step 1: Set up and activate virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: To run the Server
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### To Run PyTest Fixtures
```bash
./run_test.sh
```
