October 7th 2025

1. project structure 
2. can take long time to build -> bad from software perpectives
- hugging face/API based
- host on server
3. code switching --> not available in first release
4. testing -> more testcases
5. add more transliterators: bn, mr
6. replace ml with load_or_train_model
7. transliterator broken: stop training again add again
